// Source maps in development projects, such as those using React or other JavaScript frameworks, are a tool that map the minified and compiled code (what the browser actually runs) back to the original source code (what the developer wrote). They provide a translation between the code you wrote and what is actually being executed by the browser.

// Use Case of Source Maps
// When working with React or any front-end JavaScript framework, the code is often transformed in various ways:

// Minification: The code is compressed by removing whitespace, shortening variable names, and more.

// Transpilation: Tools like Babel or TypeScript convert newer JavaScript or JSX syntax into older syntax that can run in more browsers.

// Bundling: Tools like Webpack bundle multiple files into one or a few output files for performance.

// These transformations make the final code that runs in the browser much harder to read. This is where source maps come in: they allow developers to debug the original code, even though the browser is running the transformed version.

// How Source Maps Work
// A source map is a JSON file that maps the locations in the minified code to corresponding locations in the original code.
// When source maps are enabled, browsers and developer tools (like Chrome DevTools) can use them to show the original source code, with accurate line numbers, while debugging.
